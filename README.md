# Pingdom RESTful API Client

Pingdom now offers a RESTful API, which gives us no reason not to make a decent,
non-SOAP API client for their services.

NOTE: This is a 3rd party gem and not an official product from Pingdom.

## Usage

    client = Pingdom::Client.new :username => u, :password => p, :key => k
    check = client.checks.first #=> #<Pingdom::Check>
    check.last_response_time    #=> 200 (ms)
    check.status                #=> "up"

    result = check.results.first(:probes => [1,2,3], :status => [:up, :down])
                                #=> #<Pingdom::Result>
    result.status               #=> :up
    result.up?                  #=> true
    result.response_time        #=> 20000 (microsecs)

    avg = check.summary.average(:from   => 1.month.ago,
                                :probes => [1,2,3])
                                #=> #<Pingdom::Summary::Average>
    avg.response_time           #=> 200 (ms)
    probe_avg = avg.averages.first
    probe_avg.response_time     #=> 120 (ms)
    probe_avg.probe.name        #=> "Atlanta, GA"
